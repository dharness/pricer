# Deal Miner - Revolutionizing The Art of Coupons

A Cordova application targeted at the android platform. Simplifies the struggle of collecting coupons by amalgamating them in one place with a simple swipe interface. Users can save coupons for later use or discard unwanted coupons.

Uses basic MachineLearning library to anaylses the preferences of users and present only the most relevant coupons.

### The Need

The consumer is sick and tired of clipping coupons by hand. Deal Miner provides the answer. With a sleek interface, easy to use feature-set and sturdy back end it is the concierge of the modern consumer to the world of savings.

## How to use this Project

You will need Cordova to run this project. It currently only supports android platform but others can be added with a few simple commands. Run the server prior to running the application. 


## Future Versions

Future versions will undergo massive UI changes and ideally a swap out of the coupons API since it does not yet currrently meet the business needs. Moving forward I am planning to build a web-crawler to amass a coupon DB.

If you have suggestions to improve this project or would like to make some contribution I encourage you to fork the repo and I will view any and all merge requests.
